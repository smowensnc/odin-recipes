    <h2><strong><em>Korean BBQ Chicken Marinade</em></strong></h2> 
    <p>This Korean chicken marinade can also be used as a basting sauce or served over chicken rice bowls. It's very tasty! If you like it hot, increase the hot chile paste as desired up to four tablespoons â€” that's about as much as anyone can take!</p>
    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup soy sauce</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons hot chile paste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk sugar, soy sauce, water, onion powder, and ground ginger together in a medium saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature, 20 to 30 minutes. Whisk in lemon juice and chile paste.</li>
        
    </ol>
    <h2><strong>To Use:</strong></h2>
